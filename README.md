# BitScribe
Censorship-free way to permanetely embed data on Bitcoin (and Bitcoin-like) blockchains.

Bitcoin allows for arbitrary data inside individual transactions, but limits their size to
80 bytes. This project defines a protocol and provides a reference implementation for writing
abitrarily large documents into the canonical blockchain. It proves a highly efficient method
for minimizing the cost in terms of time and money. Documents cannot be removed without forking
the blockchain. Documents cannot be forged, overwritten, or spam attacked. Readers can
access any document with a traffic patterns indistunguishable from normal blockchain
nodes.
